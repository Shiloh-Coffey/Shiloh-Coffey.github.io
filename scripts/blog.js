    Title: "GitHub JSON workaround",
    Paragraph: "Since GitHub allows limited use of pages when it comes to adding a form of CSV or JSON file I had to come up with some workaround for what you are currently looking at on screen. By creating a separate JavaScript file that holds a list, I can reference the variable and then load the posts from that. Then in another JavaScript file, I have the list loaded and appended to this HTML page. Ideally, this same function would be used for the 'Review' page that is also planned to be on this website, with minimal tweaks to the HTML code. Ideally some sort of score box that is positioned with a flex-box.",
